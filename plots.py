Overview of the main results from the experiments:

Result # 1:
Justify the validity of our capacity regimes with realistic data.
Plot the CDF for the low, medium, and high capacity

Result # 2:
Adding privacy leads to minimal impact (across the three different capacity)
    - fractional increase in total travel time is small [can compute this number and just write it/ put in a table]
    - per-car increase (absolute numbers/ fractional increase) in travel time is small
    - Shortest paths do not change for most vehicles

    - Do this for the three capacity scenarios

Result # 3:
Higher the privacy requirement, higher the loss in performance

    - Vary epsilon, and plot the increase in total travel time for the three different capacity profiles

Result # 1: Capacities on most links are large enough to fall into our analysis regime
